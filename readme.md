## Live Whiteboard 

With the help of Vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS, I created a real-time whiteboard. Played with Canvas API and Socket.io. Used Arrays as stack for storing positions.

This real-time whiteboard provides the user with following features:
1. Draw using pencil (3 different colors, scale the pencil size)
2. Erase the drawn area using eraser(scale the eraser size)
3. Include a sticky note to make notes (feature to add multiple sticky notes, move sticky note around the drawing area, minimize and close the sticky note)
4. Upload an image or gif (feature to add multiple files,feature to move the file, close the file)
5. Download the drawing part on the user screen
6. Redo or undo the drawing content changes.
7. Zoom in or zoom out the drawing content.
8. Real-time virtual environment for drawing and erasing.

It has quite useful applications in education endeavors; such as, it may help out in remote teaching or explaining of a concept.
Tools: HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Canvas API, Socket.io
